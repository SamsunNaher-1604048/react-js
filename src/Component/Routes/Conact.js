        <p>A Little Life follows a chronological narrative with flashbacks frequently interspersed throughout.
             The novel's narrative perspectives shift throughout the story's progression. During the beginning of the novel, 
             a third-person omniscient perspective privileging the thoughts of Jude, Willem, JB and Malcolm is employed. As 
             the story gradually shifts its focus towards Jude, its perspective progressively molds entirely around each character's 
             interactions with Jude and the experiences of Jude himself. This literary perspective is punctuated by first-
             person narratives told by an older Harold, nine years in the future.</p>
